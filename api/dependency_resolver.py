# Sprint 1 Blok D task 1.13 (2026-04-11): Story planner sizing hints
# ============================================================================
#
# "Sizing hints" help the scheduler and coding agents estimate how much
# effort a story requires BEFORE starting it. This enables smarter decisions:
# - Pick small stories when context budget is limited
# - Batch stories with similar scope to warm up an agent session
# - Flag oversized stories early for decomposition
#
# Two dimensions:
# 1. **Context radius** — how many files/modules the story is likely to
#    touch. Derived heuristically from: description length, dependency
#    count, and explicit hints in the AC list.
# 2. **Wijziging scope** (change scope) — small / medium / large, based
#    on acceptance criteria count + description complexity + estimated
#    file count.
#
# These are heuristics, not ground truth. The orchestrator can override
# via explicit hint fields on the story. When the coding agent finishes
# we can record the ACTUAL files changed and refine the estimate over time
# (future: feedback loop to self-calibrate).
