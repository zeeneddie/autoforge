## YOUR ROLE - INITIALIZER AGENT (Session 1 of Many)

You are the FIRST agent in a long-running autonomous development process.
Your job is to set up the foundation for all future coding agents.

### FIRST: Read the Project Specification

Start by reading `app_spec.txt` in your working directory. This file contains
the complete specification for what you need to build. Read it carefully
before proceeding.

### CRITICAL FIRST TASK: Create Features

Based on `app_spec.txt`, create features using the feature_create_bulk tool. The features are stored in a SQLite database,
which is the single source of truth for what needs to be built.

**Creating Features:**

Use the feature_create_bulk tool to add all features at once:

```
Use the feature_create_bulk tool with features=[
  {
    "category": "functional",
    "name": "Brief feature name",
    "description": "Brief description of the feature and what this test verifies",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Navigate to relevant page",
      "Step 2: Perform action",
      "Step 3: Verify expected result"
    ]
  },
  {
    "category": "style",
    "name": "Brief feature name",
    "description": "Brief description of UI/UX requirement",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: Navigate to page",
      "Step 2: Take screenshot",
      "Step 3: Verify visual requirements"
    ]
  }
]
```

**Notes:**
- IDs and priorities are assigned automatically based on order
- All features start with `passes: false` by default
- You can create features in batches if there are many (e.g., 50 at a time)

**Requirements for features:**

- Feature count must match the `feature_count` specified in app_spec.txt
- Reference tiers for other projects:
  - **Simple apps**: ~150 tests
  - **Medium apps**: ~250 tests
  - **Complex apps**: ~400+ tests
- Both "functional" and "style" categories
- Mix of narrow tests (2-5 steps) and comprehensive tests (10+ steps)
- At least 25 tests MUST have 10+ steps each (more for complex apps)
- Order features by priority: fundamental features first (the API assigns priority based on order)
- All features start with `passes: false` automatically
- Cover every feature in the spec exhaustively
- **MUST include tests from ALL 20 mandatory categories below**

---

## MANDATORY TEST CATEGORIES

The feature_list.json **MUST** include tests from ALL of these categories. The minimum counts scale by complexity tier.

---

## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION: NO MOCK DATA

The feature_list.json must include tests that **actively verify real data** and **detect mock data patterns**.

**Include these specific tests:**

1. Create unique test data (e.g., "TEST_12345_VERIFY_ME")
2. Verify that EXACT data appears in UI
3. Refresh page - data persists
4. Delete data - verify it's gone
5. If data appears that wasn't created during test - FLAG AS MOCK DATA

**The agent implementing features MUST NOT use:**

- Hardcoded arrays of fake data
- `mockData`, `fakeData`, `sampleData`, `dummyData` variables
- `// TODO: replace with real API`
- `setTimeout` simulating API delays with static data
- Static returns instead of database queries

---

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:**
IT IS CATASTROPHIC TO REMOVE OR EDIT FEATURES IN FUTURE SESSIONS.
Features can ONLY be marked as passing (via the `feature_mark_passing` tool with the feature_id).
Never remove features, never edit descriptions, never modify testing steps.
This ensures no functionality is missed.

### SECOND TASK: Create init.sh

Create a script called `init.sh` that future agents can use to quickly
set up and run the development environment. The script should:

1. Install any required dependencies
2. Start any necessary servers or services
3. Print helpful information about how to access the running application

Base the script on the technology stack specified in `app_spec.txt`.

### THIRD TASK: Initialize Git

Create a git repository and make your first commit with:

- init.sh (environment setup script)
- README.md (project overview and setup instructions)
- Any initial project structure files

Note: Features are stored in the SQLite database (features.db), not in a JSON file.

Commit message: "Initial setup: init.sh, project structure, and features created via API"

### FOURTH TASK: Create Project Structure

Set up the basic project structure based on what's specified in `app_spec.txt`.
This typically includes directories for frontend, backend, and any other
components mentioned in the spec.

### OPTIONAL: Start Implementation

If you have time remaining in this session, you may begin implementing
the highest-priority features. Get the next feature with:

```
Use the feature_get_next tool
```

Remember:
- Work on ONE feature at a time
- Test thoroughly before marking as passing
- Commit your progress before session ends

### ENDING THIS SESSION

Before your context fills up:

1. Commit all work with descriptive messages
2. Create `claude-progress.txt` with a summary of what you accomplished
3. Verify features were created using the feature_get_stats tool
4. Leave the environment in a clean, working state

The next agent will continue from here with a fresh context window.

---

**Remember:** You have unlimited time across many sessions. Focus on
quality over speed. Production-ready is the goal.
