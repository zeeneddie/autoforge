MCP Server for Feature Management
==================================

Provides tools to manage features in the autonomous coding system,
replacing the previous FastAPI-based REST API.

Tools:
- feature_get_stats: Get progress statistics
- feature_get_next: Get next feature to implement
- feature_get_for_regression: Get random passing features for testing
- feature_mark_passing: Mark a feature as passing
- feature_skip: Skip a feature (move to end of queue)
- feature_mark_in_progress: Mark a feature as in-progress
- feature_clear_in_progress: Clear in-progress status
- feature_create_bulk: Create multiple features at once
- feature_create: Create a single feature
