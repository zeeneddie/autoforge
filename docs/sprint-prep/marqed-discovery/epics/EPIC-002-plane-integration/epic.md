# EPIC-002 | MQ Planning Integration

**Priority:** high
**Status:** planned
**Depends on:** EPIC-001

MQ Planning SDK setup and read operations for existing backlogs. This epic provides the bridge between the discovery tool and MQ Planning project management, allowing the tool to read existing modules, work items, and cycles so that brownpaper mode can load prior context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MQ Planning SDK authenticates successfully
- [ ] Modules (epics) load from MQ Planning API
- [ ] Work items (features) load with state and priority
- [ ] Cycles (sprints) load with date ranges and assigned items
