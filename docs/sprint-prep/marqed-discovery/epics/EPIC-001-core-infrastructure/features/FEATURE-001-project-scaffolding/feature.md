# FEATURE-001 | Project Scaffolding

**Priority:** high
**Status:** planned

Set up the foundational project structure with a React 18 + TypeScript + Vite frontend, a FastAPI backend with uvicorn, a Docker Compose configuration for PostgreSQL, and the shadcn/ui component library. This feature provides the runnable skeleton that all subsequent features build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React app boots on localhost:5173 with hot reload
- [ ] FastAPI serves on localhost:8000 with health endpoint
- [ ] Docker Compose starts PostgreSQL with persistent volume
- [ ] shadcn/ui base components render with Tailwind styling
