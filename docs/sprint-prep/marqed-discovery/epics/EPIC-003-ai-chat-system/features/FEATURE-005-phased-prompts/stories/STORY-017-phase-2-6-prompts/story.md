# STORY-017 | Phase 2-6 Prompts

**Priority:** high
**Status:** planned
**Depends on:** STORY-016

Implement prompt templates for Phase 2 (Scope Definition), Phase 3 (Decomposition), Phase 4 (Refinement), Phase 5 (Validation), and Phase 6 (Export). Each phase builds on the prior phase context and produces progressively more structured output.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each phase has a distinct prompt template with clear instructions
- [ ] Phase progression advances automatically when phase goals are met
- [ ] AI output matches the expected structure for each phase
- [ ] Full conversation history from prior phases included in context
- [ ] Phase 6 produces export-ready entity hierarchy
