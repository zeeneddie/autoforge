# STORY-019 | Greenpaper Mode

**Priority:** high
**Status:** planned
**Depends on:** STORY-016

Implement greenpaper mode which starts with a blank context and interviews the PM about their vision and requirements from scratch. The AI uses open-ended discovery questions to build the project hierarchy without any pre-existing assumptions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No pre-loaded context when session starts in greenpaper mode
- [ ] AI begins with broad, open-ended questions about project vision
- [ ] Entity hierarchy builds progressively from PM responses
- [ ] Session transitions smoothly through all phases from blank start
