# EPIC-003 | AI Chat System

**Priority:** high
**Status:** planned
**Depends on:** EPIC-001

Claude API integration with a phased prompt system for structured product discovery conversations. This epic covers the AI backbone: SDK setup, streaming responses, token tracking, and the six-phase prompt pipeline that guides PMs from initial context gathering through to validated export-ready hierarchies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Claude API responds to prompts correctly
- [ ] Streaming delivers tokens in real-time via SSE
- [ ] Phase progression moves through all six phases
- [ ] Brownpaper and greenpaper modes produce distinct conversation flows
