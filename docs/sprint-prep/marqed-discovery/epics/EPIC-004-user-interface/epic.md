# EPIC-004 | User Interface

**Priority:** high
**Status:** planned
**Depends on:** EPIC-001, EPIC-003

Chat interface and hierarchy tree view. This epic delivers the two primary UI surfaces: an assistant-ui powered chat panel for PM conversations with the AI, and a live-updating hierarchical tree view that visualizes the generated entity structure as it grows during the discovery session.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Chat interface renders and accepts user input
- [ ] Messages stream token-by-token from the backend
- [ ] Hierarchy tree updates live as new entities are generated
- [ ] Split-screen layout works on desktop and collapses on mobile
