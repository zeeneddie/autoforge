# FEATURE-007 | Hierarchy Tree

**Priority:** high
**Status:** planned
**Depends on:** FEATURE-002

Build a hierarchical tree view component that displays discovery entities (epics, features, stories) with expand/collapse. Tree updates in real-time via SSE when the AI generates new entities. Integrate into a resizable split-screen layout with the chat panel.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tree renders three-level entity hierarchy with expand/collapse
- [ ] New entities appear in real-time without page refresh
- [ ] Split-screen layout with resizable drag handle works on desktop
