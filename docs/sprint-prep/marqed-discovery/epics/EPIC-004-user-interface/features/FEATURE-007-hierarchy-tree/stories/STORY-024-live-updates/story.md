# STORY-024 | Live Updates

**Priority:** high
**Status:** planned
**Depends on:** STORY-023, STORY-014

Connect the hierarchy tree to SSE events so it updates in real-time when the AI generates new entities. New nodes appear with smooth fade-in animations, and the tree auto-expands to reveal newly added items.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New entities appear in the tree without requiring a page refresh
- [ ] Smooth fade-in animation plays when nodes are added
- [ ] Tree auto-expands parent nodes to show newly created items
- [ ] Rapid entity creation does not cause rendering glitches
