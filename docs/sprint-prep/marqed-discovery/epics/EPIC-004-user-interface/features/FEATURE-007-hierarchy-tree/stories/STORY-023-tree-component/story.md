# STORY-023 | Tree Component

**Priority:** high
**Status:** planned
**Depends on:** STORY-006

Build a hierarchical tree view component that displays discovery entities in three levels: epics, features, and stories. Each node supports expand/collapse toggling, shows entity counts per level, and handles the empty state when no entities exist yet.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tree renders three nested levels of entities correctly
- [ ] Expand/collapse toggles work on each tree node
- [ ] Entity count badges shown per level
- [ ] Empty state displays a helpful message when no entities exist
