# STORY-025 | Split-Screen Layout

**Priority:** high
**Status:** planned
**Depends on:** STORY-023, STORY-020

Implement a resizable split-screen layout with the chat panel on the left and the hierarchy tree on the right. Include a draggable handle for resizing, enforce minimum panel widths, and collapse to a single panel with a toggle button on mobile viewports.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Split-screen renders with chat on left and tree on right
- [ ] Drag handle resizes panels smoothly
- [ ] Minimum widths enforced to prevent panels from collapsing entirely
- [ ] Mobile viewport shows a single panel with a toggle to switch
