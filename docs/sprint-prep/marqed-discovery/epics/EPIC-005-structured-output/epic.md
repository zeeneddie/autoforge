# EPIC-005 | Structured Output

**Priority:** medium
**Status:** planned
**Depends on:** EPIC-003

Claude structured output schema for entity generation. This epic defines the JSON schemas that constrain Claude's output into well-typed Epic, Feature, and Story entities, ensuring that AI-generated hierarchies are machine-parseable, validated, and ready for persistence and Plane export.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Output schema validates against all entity types
- [ ] Claude API returns structured JSON matching the schema
- [ ] Generated entities parse correctly into typed models
