    Create a Claude Agent SDK client with multi-layered security.

        project_dir: Directory for the project
        model: Claude model to use

    Returns:
        Configured ClaudeSDKClient (from claude_agent_sdk)

    Security layers (defense in depth):
    1. Sandbox - OS-level bash command isolation prevents filesystem escape
    2. Permissions - File operations restricted to project_dir only
    3. Security hooks - Bash commands validated against an allowlist
       (see security.py for ALLOWED_COMMANDS)

    Note: Authentication is handled by start.bat/start.sh before this runs.
    The Claude SDK auto-detects credentials from ~/.claude/.credentials.json
